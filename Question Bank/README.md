## ✅ Q1. What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simple syntax and readability. It is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and software development.

---

## ✅ Q2. What is a variable in Python?

A variable is a name given to a memory location used to store data. Python does not require declaring data types.

Example:

```python
x = 10
name = "Vibhav"
```

---

## ✅ Q3. Write the syntax to take input from the user.

Python uses the `input()` function to take input from the user.

```python
num = input("Enter a number: ")
```

---

## ✅ Q4. Name any two data types in Python.

Two common data types are:

* int – whole numbers
* float – decimal numbers

---

## ✅ Q5. What is the use of import statement?

The `import` statement is used to include built-in or user-defined modules so their functions and variables can be used.

Example:

```python
import math
```

---

## ✅ Q6. Which keyword is used to display output?

The `print()` function is used to display output on the screen.

---

## ✅ Q7. What is the use of elif?

`elif` is used to check multiple conditions after `if` when more than two conditions are required.

---

## ✅ Q8. What is a list in Python?

A list is an ordered, mutable collection used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Example:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30]
```

---

## ✅ Q9. Which loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown?

The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. It runs as long as the condition is true.

---

## ✅ Q10. What does break do in a loop?

The `break` statement immediately terminates the loop and transfers control outside the loop.

---

## ✅ Q11. What does continue do in a loop?

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

---

## ✅ Q12. What is a string?

A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single, double, or triple quotes.

Example:

```python
text = "Python"
```

---

## ✅ Q13. How do you find the length of a string?

The length of a string is found using the built-in `len()` function.

Example:

```python
len("Python")
```

---

## ✅ Q14. What is type casting?

Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another, such as int, float, or string.

Example:

```python
x = int("10")
```

---

## ✅ Q15. Write the symbol for single-line comment in Python.

The symbol used for single-line comment in Python is:
