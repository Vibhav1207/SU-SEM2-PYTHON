## Q1. What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simple syntax and readability. It is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and software development.

## Q2. What is a variable in Python?
A variable is a name given to a memory location used to store data. Python does not require declaring data types.

Example:
```python
x = 10
name = "Vibhav"
```

## Q3. Write the syntax to take input from the user.
Python uses the input() function to take input from the user.

```python
num = input("Enter a number: ")
```

## Q4. Name any two data types in Python.
Two common data types are:
- int – whole numbers
- float – decimal numbers

## Q5. What is the use of import statement?
The import statement is used to include built-in or user-defined modules so their functions and variables can be used.

Example:
```python
import math
```

## Q6. Which keyword is used to display output?
The print() function is used to display output on the screen.

## Q7. What is the use of elif?
elif is used to check multiple conditions after if when more than two conditions are required.

## Q8. What is a list in Python?
A list is an ordered, mutable collection used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Example:
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30]
```

## Q9. Which loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown?
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. It runs as long as the condition is true.

## Q10. What does break do in a loop?
The break statement immediately terminates the loop and transfers control outside the loop.

## Q11. What does continue do in a loop?
The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

## Q12. What is a string?
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single, double, or triple quotes.

Example:
```python
text = "Python"
```

## Q13. How do you find the length of a string?
Use the built-in len() function.

```python
len("Python")
```

## Q14. What is type casting?
Type casting converts one data type into another, such as int, float, or string.

Example:
```python
x = int("10")
```

## Q15. Write the symbol for single-line comment in Python.
Use # for single-line comments.
